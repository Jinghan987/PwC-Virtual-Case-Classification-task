# PwC-Virtual-Case-Classification-task
This classification task is one of the tasks in PwC Virtual Case Experience. Using the bank information dataset given, I will attempt to find out which customers will subscribe to a bank term deposit. I will do so by first determining the best features using statistical methods like correlation and information gain and from there, classification will be conducted on the dataset.
